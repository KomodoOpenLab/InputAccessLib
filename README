To make your application Tecla Accessible follow the standard procedure:

1. Include the package ca.idi.tecla.lib in your application.
2. Create an instance of the class InputAccess say inputAccess giving the activity under consideration as a parameter to its constructor.
3. Call the method inputAccess.onCreate() inside your activity's overriden onCreate(Bundle) method.
4. Make sure you override the onPause(), onResume() and onDestroy() methods in your activity.
5. Add the line inputAccess.onPause() to overriden onPause() method, inputAccess.onResume() to the overriden onResume() method and inputAccess.onDestroy() to the overriden onDestroy() method.
6. Add the return statement inputAccess.onPrepareOptionsMenu(menu) to the method public boolean onPrepareOptionsMenu(Menu menu); in your activity, if you dont have any such method create one.

Note:
1. You can turn the accessibilty feature on or off by calling setAccessible(boolean) method.(Caution: It will hide the menu if one is currently visible).
2. You can check if the accessible version of dialog is currently visible by calling inputAccess.isMenuDialogShowing().
